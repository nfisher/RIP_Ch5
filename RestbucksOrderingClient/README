Note:

This module uses Ant and IVY to build the codebase.  IVY is bootstrapped from the ant script,
this is done so that you do not need to install it yourself.  It is also configured so as to
keep all artifacts within this directory tree, ivy is downloaded to {cwd}/.ivy and resolution
artifacts are downloaded to {cwd}/.ivy/cache



Build Instructions
==================

Build the RestbucksOrderingService first since this module re-uses much of the test
infrastructure in that module. Then build this module with:

bash$ ant
